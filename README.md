# Open Terms Archive Contribution Tool Prototype

This is the repository for `contribute.opentermsarchive.org`, the proof of concept of a tool that helps users create declarations for [Open Terms Archive](https://opentermsarchive.org) collections.

## Status

This codebase is untested and should be considered as a proof of concept only, usable by trained contributors for specific cases where reliability is not critical. **It is not safe to deploy in production.**

## Introduction

Build on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) react framework, using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` file at the root of the project and fill in the values of the constants.

Note that you can use [Nextjs Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#loading-environment-variables) if you wish to add more environment variables

### `PORT`

Port on which the website will run.

Example `PORT=5000`
Default is `3000`

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`

To deploy the website under a sub-path of a domain you can use this env variable config option.

Example `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH="/prefix"`
Default is empty

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`

In order for the service to automatically create issues in Github when a submitting a new service declaration, you need the below environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: A token with repository privileges which allow access to the [GitHub API](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

### `GITLAB_TOKEN`

In order for the service to automatically create issues in GitLab when a submitting a new service declaration, you need the below environment variables:

- `GITLAB_TOKEN`: A token with the api scope which allows access to the [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

### `GITLAB_TOKEN_VERSIONS`

In order for the service to read from the versions repository in GitLab to edit a commit, you need the below environment variables:

- `GITLAB_TOKEN_VERSIONS`: A token with the read_api scope which allows read access to the [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

### `GITLAB_URL`

In order for the service to use the GitLab APIs to interact with the repositories, you need the below environment variables:

- `GITLAB_URL`: The base api url of the GitLab server (for example it would be https://gitlab.com/api/v4/ if hosted on gitlab.com).

### `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID`

In order for the service to use the GitLab APIs to interact with the declarations repository, you need the below environment variables:

- `GITLAB_PROJECT_ID`: The project ID of the repository.

### `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATOMO_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MATOMO_SITE_ID`

You can easily set up analytics with [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) by providing those 2 values.

## Contribution interface Usage

### Destination repository (Mandatory)

The contribution interface can be used against any repository on which github user which generated the `GITHUB_TOKEN` has issue creation rights.

This repo must be passed by an url parameter called `destination`

Here are some examples for contributing to different projects using

- /en?destination=OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations
- /en?destination=OpenTermsArchive/dating-declarations
- /en?destination=OpenTermsArchive/sandbox (For tests)

### Usage

Once `destination` is setup, you need to enter an url and follow the written guidelines.

After selecting the page parts you want to track, clicking on `Validate` will automatically create an issue in the given `destination` github repository.

In case this automatic creation does not work, a fallback is setup, opening a `mailto` link with prepopulated data.

#### Local creation of services from contribution interface

If you are interested in setting up a local instance where you can locally save the result of the contribution interface, you have to specify where to save it.
This can be done with a url parameter called `localPath`.

It takes a full local path string and must point to the exact folder containing the declarations.
See below examples:

```
/en?destination=OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations&localPath=/Users/username/Workspace/OpenTermsArchive/contrib-declarations/declarations
/en?destination=OpenTermsArchive/dating-declarations&localPath=/Users/username/Workspace/somewhere-else/dating-declarations/declarations
```

This way, a `Save on local` button will appear on the contribution interface. By clicking on it, it will add or modify the service declaration (saved as a `.json` file) in the corresponding directory.

### Automatically generating history file

As we want to ensure we can retrace the whole history of selectors we used to retrieve the corresponding documents, a history file should be created **every time you change the service declaration** (See the corresponding [decision record](./decision-record/0002-service-history.md).
As this is a very time consuming thing to do (retrieve the last version date, format it in ISO format and pasting it in a history file), an attempt to find this date has been implemented.
When having the [Local creation of services from contribution interface](#local-creation-of-services-from-contribution-interface) feature enabled, if a service file already exists, the contribution tool will try to retrieve the first error referenced on GitHub concerning this document, will fetch its date and add the record to the history file.
This will not always be accurate but we'll use this until the core of Open Terms Archive provides such a feature.
